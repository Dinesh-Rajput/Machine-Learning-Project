Problem setting
A bank wants to predict the creditworthiness of its customers. Based on the customer
records, the credit history, etc., a customer should be classified as creditworthy or unworthy
of credit. It is five times more ‘expensive’ for the bank to rate a customer who is unworthy
of credit as creditworthy than vice versa. In addition, not all information is available for all
customers. For 1,000 representatively selected customers, the creditworthiness is known.
For these customers the following data has been collected. (Features for which not all
values are known are marked with the addition “incomplete”.)
 Status of existing checking account
– A11: ... < 0 EUR
– A12: 0 ≤ ... < 200 EUR
– A13: ... ≥ 200 EUR / salary assignments for at least 1 year

– A32: existing credits paid back duly till now
